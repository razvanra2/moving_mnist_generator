# moving_mnist_generator
This projects uses GANs and clustering Data Mining techniques to form a generator for anomalous images like the ones found in moving mnist datasets.
This project is based on DCGANs: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan
and https://github.com/brngl/anomalous-Moving_MNIST
